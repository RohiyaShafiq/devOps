# Containers:
- Containers are lightweight packages of your application code together with dependencies such as specific versions of programming language runtimes and libraries required to run your software services.
- Virtualize the operating system and run anywhere, from a private data center to the public cloud or even on a developerâ€™s personal laptop.
- Containers offer a logical packaging mechanism in which applications can be abstracted from the environment in which they actually run.
- Containers share the OS kernel and use a fraction of the memory VMs require
- Benefits of containers:
    - Separation of responsibility
    - Workload portability
    - Application isolation    
## LXC:
- LXC is a well-known Linux container runtime that consists of tools, templates, and library and language bindings.
- Facilitates creating and managing application containers and systems.
- The easiest and most sensible way to use Linux Containers is by linking each container to a process, allowing for complete control.
- LXC has a simple command line interface that improves the user experience when starting containers.
- In simple terms, it has stuff that helps three different entities:
    - It helps the computer boot up and use its hardware properly.
    - It helps programs do their work by providing the required libraries, or whatever is needed.
    - It helps human beings use that computer and do their work.
